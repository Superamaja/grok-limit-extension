# Grok Rate Limit UI

A simple Chrome extension that displays your Grok rate limits directly in the Grok web interface.

## Description

This Chrome extension enhances your Grok experience by providing real-time visibility into your rate limits. Instead of wondering how many requests you have left, the extension adds a small counter directly in the Grok interface that displays your remaining requests out of your total allocation.

The counter updates automatically whenever you send a message to Grok, as that's when the site fetches rate limit information from the API.

## Features

- üìä Displays remaining/total API requests
- üé® Color-coded indicator (green ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí red) based on usage
- üîÑ Automatically updates after each message
- ‚ö° Lightweight with minimal performance impact
- üõ°Ô∏è Requires no additional permissions beyond accessing Grok
